<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a member of the Technical Staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the [Cyber System Assessments Group](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/cyber-system-assessments) and finishing a Computer Science PhD at <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a>. My research interests focus on the intersection of dynamic program analysis, firmware security, and vulnerability discovery. In particular, I am interested in **rehosting** firmware into virtual environments where it will run correctly while also being closely analyzed and monitored. Towards this end, I have contributed to the development of a number of open source tools, most notably <a href="https://panda.re" target="_blank">PANDA-re</a>, a whole-system dynamic analysis platform that can be used for dynamic analysis of both traditional software systems and firmware. I've also developed courses focused on dynamic program analysis, whole system dynamic analysis, and firmware security which I've taught across the country and internationally at various universities and companies.

All my publications are available as open access, at <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y9XVfSIAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Training materials can be shared upon request, and I am always happy to discuss my research and teaching.
