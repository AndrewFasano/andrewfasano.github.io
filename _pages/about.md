<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a member of the Technical Staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the [Cyber System Assessments Group](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/cyber-system-assessments) where I research the intersection of dynamic program analysis, firmware security, and vulnerability discovery. In particular, I am interested in **rehosting** firmware into virtual environments where it will run correctly while also being closely analyzed and monitored. Towards this end, I have contributed to the development of a number of open source tools. I've also developed courses focused on dynamic program analysis, whole system dynamic analysis, and firmware security which I've taught at various universities and companies both in the US and abroad. I am a proud alumnus of Northeastern University, where I earned my PhD in Computer Science, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where I earned a BS in Computer Science and was an active member of RPISEC.

All my publications are available as open access, at <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y9XVfSIAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Training materials can be shared upon request, and I am always happy to discuss my research and teaching.

# üßë‚Äçüíª Open Source Projects
- **Hypervisor Dissociative Execution**: A framework for dynamic analysis of virtualized guest systems based on system call injection. [GitHub Repository](http://github.com/andrewFasano/hyde).
- **Firmware Rehosting**: _Suite of tools for automated firmware rehosting and dynamic analysis of firmware to be released alongside BAR 2025 publication_
- **PANDA.re**: A whole-system dynamic analysis platform for reverse engineering and software understanding. Fork of the QEMU codebase with significant modifications to enable record/replay, a plugin architecture, and Python based analyses. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/panda-re/panda). [Project Website](https://panda.re)
- **LAVA**: An automated framework for injecting vulnerabilities into software to evaluate bug-finding systems. LAVA uses PANDA's whole-system dynamic taint analysis to identify how input data flow through a program and uses this information to propose and evaluate patches to soruce code to add vulnerabilities. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/panda-re/lava) (No longer maintained)
- **Rode0day**: A vulnerability discovery competition powered by LAVA where users compete to find new bugs each month. Unlike prior self-evaluations, Rode0day competitors had no knowledge of where the bugs were until we released the solutions after each competition ended. [Project website](https://rode0day.mit.edu) (No longer maintained)
