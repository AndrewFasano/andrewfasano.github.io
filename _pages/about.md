<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior cybersecurity researcher focused on the cyber capabilities of AI systems. At the US AI Safety Institute (AISI), I leverage my background in cyber capability evaluation to assess current and next-generation AI models, studying the relationship between the capability frontier and potential cyber harms while advancing the science of AI security evaluations.

Previously, I spent a decade at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the [Cyber System Assessments Group](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/cyber-system-assessments) where I led a research team focused on the intersection of dynamic program analysis, firmware security, and vulnerability discovery. In this role, I helped define the field of _firmware rehosting_ while building open-source tools and applying them to analyze critical systems' security. This work in systems security evaluation and testing methodology now informs my approach to understanding AI systems' capabilities and security implications.

I earned my PhD in Computer Science from Northeastern University and BS from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where I was an active member of RPISEC. I'm passionate about cybersecurity education and have developed courses for universities, government agencies, and private companies. The materials from my System Security with Dynamic Program Analysis course are <a href="https://github.com/andrewFasano/dpa" target="_blank">publicly available</a>.

All my publications are available as open access on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y9XVfSIAAAAJ'>Google Scholar</a>.

# üßë‚Äçüíª Open Source Projects
- **Hypervisor Dissociative Execution**: A framework for dynamic analysis of virtualized guest systems based on system call injection. [GitHub Repository](http://github.com/andrewFasano/hyde).
- **Firmware Rehosting**: _Suite of tools for automated firmware rehosting and dynamic analysis of firmware to be released alongside BAR 2025 publication_
- **PANDA.re**: A whole-system dynamic analysis platform for reverse engineering and software understanding. Fork of the QEMU codebase with significant modifications to enable record/replay, a plugin architecture, and Python based analyses. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/panda-re/panda). [Project Website](https://panda.re)
- **LAVA**: An automated framework for injecting vulnerabilities into software to evaluate bug-finding systems. LAVA uses PANDA's whole-system dynamic taint analysis to identify how input data flow through a program and uses this information to propose and evaluate patches to soruce code to add vulnerabilities. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/panda-re/lava) (No longer maintained)
- **Rode0day**: A vulnerability discovery competition powered by LAVA where users compete to find new bugs each month. Unlike prior self-evaluations, Rode0day competitors had no knowledge of where the bugs were until we released the solutions after each competition ended. [Project website](https://rode0day.mit.edu) (No longer maintained)
